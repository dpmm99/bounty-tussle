Not tested: ([e] = expansion, [a] = aggressive option)



Next steps:
Done: Make a board editor (at least click to place nodes and right-click to link them)
Done: Create an expansion board (needs 6 start locations and some wider areas)
Done: Put in the enemy and station randomizers
Done: Add proper graphics
Done: Client and server can start a game and save it in the DB
Done: Server can load and replay game from DB
Done: Client can load and replay game from server
Done: Client can send moves to server and advance the game (and then advance locally according to the server's response, including loading hidden information only once it's meant to be available to players)
Done: Server caches games loaded from the DB
Done (only happy path tested): Implement Discord SSO (copy and paste from Burgustar) and validate if requests are for the authenticated player
Done: Make a landing/login/New Game page, including the "search for players who have logged in before" feature, copied and pasted from Burgustar
Done: Set client to poll server for updates
Done (could show a lot more data): Make a "games I'm playing" list on that same page
Done: Display the events somewhere other than the dev console
Done: Pop up info on hover over a character during character selection
Done: Pop up info when you hover your cursor over a map node, especially if there are multiple tokens there (hard to see 'em)
Done: Put on my website
Done: Fix how picking multiple different characters in a row doesn't update your UI or local RoundManager
Done: Get the OAuth token expiration from Discord instead of always setting the session expiration to 1 week
Done: Persist the user sessions to the database
Done: Make the text clickable and not just the checkboxes on the New Game page
Done: Add info buttons to the options on the New Game page
Done: Add rolled-die-face graphics

Done: game ranking is all piled on top of itself
Done: There's an issue with first login that throws 403 errors
Done: Player action validation was failing for new players
Done: The player marker tokens need to be associated with the characters somewhere
Done: The enemy damage dealt amount needs to be displayed somewhere
Done: Missiles shouldn't say they "increased by undefined" when obtaining a missile tank
Done: Base game map needs a ship when not playing with the Aggressive option
Done: Ensure sync doesn't stop when it's your turn but asking permission from another player
Done: Switch movement rolls to 2 D6
Done: Make health and missile refills 3 if you roll 10, 2 if you roll 6-9, or 1 otherwise instead of 3 if you roll 10, 1 if you roll 7-9, or 0 otherwise
Done: Stop syncing when the game ends
Done: Upgrades shouldn't give bounty
Done: Space pirates should give 2 bounty
Done: Player should not have to ask to attack another enemy after giving a different player permission to attack that same enemy
Testing: "Accept Defeat" disappeared because the next player played. And then Accept Defeat was there during other people's turns
Testing: Your token doesn't disappear on defeat while others keep playing
Testing: Player cookie should not randomly disappear (may have been due to the bad playerId on first login thing)
Got out of sync while clicking too often
Maybe also add +2 to the base movement distance
Also need another way to refill health, maybe multiple rolls for tougher enemies, but increasing travel speed (to a recharge station) and base amount for refill rolls may be enough
Someone kept crashing my server entirely
It's possible to get redirected to wrong URL without the /server
Dodging to a station doesn't allow activating the station. I knew that, but I decided maybe it should after all (because it takes 2 moves to activate the station after that).
Player info/stats should be on a separate canvas set to "position: fixed" so you can still see the info while scrolling (plus it can easily exceed the screen width as-is)
Add keyboard controls and put node numbers in the tooltip
Make players able to leave the game at any time
Make players able to reset their turn to the last irreversible step (a roll or reveal)
Show who's a part of (and playing what character and possibly has what score) each game in the game list + date started

Later:
Make an instruction manual

Could do:
Add "Players who saved here:" and "Players who haven't used this upgrade station:" to the info pop-ups
Show multiple tokens in the same space side-by-side instead of overlapping
Animate movement of tokens
Make graphics for the boards, tunnels, and superheated spaces
Separate "expansion rules" from "include expansion pieces"
Replace the options text at the top (or at least make them obviously buttons, and for movement, use arrows to indicate the direction; could even highlight the node the action would take place in when you hover over them)
Replace (most of) the text at the top of the main canvas with token trays; possibly split it out to a separate canvas (can also make character selection a separate canvas if the pop-up info is a separate canvas); add nickname there
Replace the gameplay log with a canvas (but still allow scrolling and copying)--or at least HTML with images and a highlight for new entries that fades over time
Add timed confirm button for each automatic action
Sabotage missile upgrade stations if another one is known to the players in Aggressive Counter-Op; double-check that they get sabotaged even if passed by and had already been used before (must update version and maybe even pass version to RoundManager--probably better to keep old versions in separate files and get the version from the first call to CatchUp)
Consider restricting ships to be usable only by the player who started there
Come up with something to make single-player more meaningful
Include other SSO options (Facebook, Microsoft, Google)
Make the find users page fancier and more helpful (show Discord avatars, show Discord friends and their online status)
Indicate user status (show who's playing, including their avatar)
Allow voting to skip a player's turn if they take a while
Show multiple options instead of not giving either if a map node has multiple possible actions (e.g., attack or dodge-and-stop, or 3 attacks)
Allow moving the log window around
Allow accepting/rejecting of invites
Allow repositioning of the separate canvases
Metagame (at least give players "XP" to show how much they've played when displayed in their friends' lists)
Interactive explanation of the rules (e.g., "why can't I see an attack button?")
Make a second expansion with more upgrades (long beam, reveal distance increase, teleport station, event cards, gravity suit + water, phazon suit + phazon, that Mother Brain fight I described in the old doc, escape sequence, escape routes that get blocked off as you approach if you roll a die under a certain number, more enemy types, more playable characters like Trace, Gandrayda, Ghor, Rundas, Anthony)
Build-your-own-board mode (requires converting the board layout/token placement code to a data structure and adding a table for other players to use and polishing the board editor with token placement and drag-to-select and a list of interaction buttons/keys and such)
"Lawbreaker" option to allow direct PvP combat
Custom mode (enable all the expansion and option effects at a more granular level and customization of stats and how many of each token can appear)
Sabotaged upgrade station graphic (I didn't include this because there'd be no need to have that in the board game, but it's a cool sprite 😅)

BGA:
re-theme it to something not obviously Metroid (has to be public domain)
use BGA APIs
